Which means Dynamic Parts of the Website will be taken care by JavaScript Server side processes using APIs accessed over HTTPS done by JavaScript. This is where STRAPI comes in. Strapi is a CMS (Content Management System) where all the Site's content and other assets are Stored in Strapi and templated markup is prebuilt at deploy time often using a static-site generator which is taken care by Gatsby. \n\nLet's Have a look about it in detail..\n\n#### Why Static Site Generator ?\n\n- **Speed:** Because in static site generator there are no Database calls. All the Content being pre-generated makes loading super-fast.\n- **Simplified Hosting:** Dish is already ready. We just need to serve it. Hosting can be made within few minutes sometimes even seconds. Hosting just need to serve Static files.\n- **Better Security:** Without server-side code or Database there is no need with Security fixes and Patches. \n- **Better Developer Experience:** Setting up a Static Site with hosting like Netlify or Zeit is very straight-forward, with continuous deployment, we just need to push our changes to our Code Repository and it will be immediately reflected in live version.  \n \n#### Gatsby and React Awesomeness:\n\n- Gatsby is built with React. We can take all the advantage of React to build interactive / re-usable components in React.\n- It is also built on top of GraphQL so we can easily query our data in any way we want.\n- Gatsby provides us some cool [Starter-templates](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/) which reduces our work and saves time in setting up our Project structure.\n- It's [Plug-ins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) are so rich enough. You will almost find everything needed for your website.  \n \n##### This is how Gatsby works:\n\n![gatsby](https://res.cloudinary.com/alpha-devfolio/image/upload/v1594363154/gatsby_32e556f9df.png)\n\n##### Final Notes on Gatsby:\n\n- Gatsby is built with [Performance](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/performance/) in Mind. It delivers what it says.\n- Rich Features. It behaves like a PWA (Progressive Web Application) React Appliaction and it is really fun to play with.\n- Better UI, UX, SEO and much more.\n- Simplified Architecture and Easy Hosting.\n\n![gatsby-flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/alpha-devfolio/image/upload/v1594377178/projects-4_7e3f5ce826.png)\n\n#### Why I love Strapi? Why you should try it too..\n\nStrapi is a Open-Source Node.js Headless CMS (But it definitely has Brain 😋 ). Back then, server-side rendering of web pages was heavily used and servers were solely responsible to generate the entire web page for the clients. But nowadays we might need API driven architecture using CMS.\n\n##### Major Advantages of STRAPI : \n\n- It supports all **CRUD** Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and it is secure.\n- Every API needs to have server-side pagination, which is by default supported by Strapi.\n- It supports **SQL** and **NoSQL DB**.\n- Supports **OAuth2** Authentication. We can maintain Roles and Users with API level access.\n- We can use **REST** or **GraphQL** based on our needs.\n\n![Screenshot 2020-07-10 at 9.34.25 AM](https://res.cloudinary.com/alpha-devfolio/image/upload/v1594362687/Screenshot_2020-07-10_at_9.34.25_AM_64eff7145e.png)\n\n> **Fun Fact**: The Name \"STRAPI\" comes from \"Bootstrap your API\"\n\nConsider trying out Gatsby for Front-end and Strapi to have all your content to be served to your Front-end.
